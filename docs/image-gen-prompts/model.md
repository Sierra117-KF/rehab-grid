I want to create images to be used for rehabilitation self-training materials. First, I will prepare a fixed model that will be common to all materials.

- Full-body shot of a friendly Japanese woman.
- Her hair is black and tied back in a short ponytail.
- Light blue T-shirt and black leggings (training wear). \*The clothing should be form-fitting to clearly define the person's silhouette, making posture and movements easier to understand.
- Gentle smile.
- Realistic photographic style.
- White background.
- High image quality.
- Presented from three angles: front, true side, and true back.
